      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-center mb-4">About Earthquake Prediction</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Earthquake prediction is a highly complex and evolving field of geosciences that aims to foresee when and where earthquakes are likely to occur. Despite significant advances in technology and data analysis, accurately predicting earthquakes remains a major scientific challenge. Earthquake prediction models leverage seismic data, machine learning algorithms, and sophisticated statistical techniques to analyze patterns in the Earth's crust and forecast seismic events.

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Earthquake prediction refers to the scientific attempt to estimate:
        <strong> Location </strong> (where an earthquake will happen),
        <strong> Time </strong> (when it will occur), and
        <strong> Magnitude </strong> (how powerful the earthquake will be). Unlike earthquake forecasting (which provides long-term probabilities over years or decades), earthquake prediction aims to provide precise information in the short term (days or hours), but this level of accuracy is still out of reach.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>How Does Earthquake Prediction Work?</strong>
        <br />
        The earthquake prediction process generally follows these steps:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Seismic Data Analysis</strong>: Seismologists monitor ground vibrations, crustal movements, and foreshocks using seismic sensors placed across tectonically active regions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Machine Learning & Predictive Models</strong>: Using historical seismic data and machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and provide predictions based on factors such as seismic records, geological features, and past quakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-Time Monitoring</strong>: Systems collect and analyze seismic data from networks of sensors to detect tremors and provide alerts in real-time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>Challenges in Earthquake Prediction</strong>
        <br />
        Despite advancements, earthquake prediction faces hurdles due to:
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>The complex, non-linear behavior of the Earth's crust</li>
          <li>Inconsistent indicators compared to other natural events</li>
          <li>Unpredictable interactions between tectonic plates</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        However, machine learning models, earthquake early warning systems, and satellite data are paving the way for progress in this field.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Future of Earthquake Prediction</strong>
        <br />
        The future of earthquake prediction lies in integrating technologies like big data, quantum computing, and IoT sensors to develop more accurate predictive models. These advances will improve disaster preparedness, potentially saving lives and reducing damage.
